# KRtDL Level Randomizer

This software allows you to automatically randomize a large amount of KRtDL level files.
Although this software was intended for the Wii version of KRtDL, the switch remake KRtDL DX should work fine although it wasn't tested as much so you still may experience crashes in game. I apologize for this.

This randomizer was made possible with the work of firubii who made the KirbyLib library.

Enjoy!
